    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard <br>dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially <br>unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and <br>more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
